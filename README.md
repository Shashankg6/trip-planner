# trip-planner

Python script to help plan trips by reading in a search parameter (i.e. “restaurants”, “hotels”, “parks”) from user input, querying the Google Places API, and returning the top 60 locations that match the search as a well-formatted CSV 

Please note you will need a Google API key to use. 

Happy Planning!
