# trip-planner

Python script to help plan trips by reading in a search parameter (i.e. “restaurants”, “hotels”, “parks”) from user input, querying the Google Places API, and returning the top 60 locations that match the search as a well-formatted CSV. It will return info like name of resource, hours schedule, url, phone number, address, and category.

Please note you will need a Google API key to use. 

Also, please update the local path to save the CSV output of resources.

Happy Planning!
